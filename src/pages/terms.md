## DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

In those rare instances where your concern is not resolved to your satisfaction through calls to
our customer care, you and us each agree to try to resolve those disputes in good faith after you
provide written notice of the dispute as set forth below. If the dispute is not resolved, you and us
agree that the dispute will be resolved through individual binding arbitration or small claims
court, instead of courts of general jurisdiction.

Mandatory Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action. Instead of suing in court, you and
Wholesalers Advantage agree to arbitrate all Disputes (as defined below) on an individual, non-
representative, basis. You agree that, by accepting the terms and conditions of this Use
Agreement, you and Wholesalers Advantage are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
participate in a class action or representative action. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be
broadly interpreted.

In arbitration, there is no judge or jury. Disputes are instead decided by a neutral third-party
arbitrator in a more informal process than in court. In arbitration, there is limited discovery and
the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts. However, just as a court would,
the arbitrator must honor the terms and conditions of the Use Agreement and can award damages
and relief, including any attorneys’ fees authorized by law.

“Disputes” shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies against each other
related in any way to or arising out of in any way the WA Service or this Use Agreement,
including, but not limited to, billing services and practices, policies, contract practices (including
enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, even if the claim arises after use of or
access or subscription to the WA Service has terminated. Disputes also include, but are not

limited to, claims that: (a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of the WA Service brings
against Wholesalers Advantage (including the WA Service), its subsidiaries, affiliates, parent
companies, employees, subcontractors, agents, vendors, suppliers, providers, or licensors; (b)
you bring against a third party, such as a the Provider, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of
in any way the use of or access or subscription to the WA Service or this Use Agreement; or (c)
Wholesalers Advantage brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i)
claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and
Wholesalers Advantage, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation,
advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before this Use Agreement or
out of a prior Use Agreement with Wholesalers Advantage ; (iii) claims that are subject to on-
going litigation where you are not a party or class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after the
termination of your use of or access or subscription to the WA Service or this Use Agreement.

## DISPUTE NOTICE AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PERIOD

Before initiating arbitration or a small claims matter, you and Wholesalers Advantage each agree
to first provide to the other a written notice (“Notice of Dispute”), which shall contain: (a) a
written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a
statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute to Wholesalers Advantage should be
sent to Wholesalers Advantage, 1201 S Main Street Ste 204, Boerne, TX., 78006, Attn: Officers.
Wholesalers Advantage will provide a Notice of Dispute to you at your last known physical
address or email address. Wholesalers Advantage will assign a representative to work with you
and try to resolve your Dispute to your satisfaction. You and Wholesalers Advantage agree to
make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action.
If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute,
you or Wholesalers Advantage may commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action.
We may resolve Disputes in small claims court in Kendall County, Texas (or such other location
to which Wholesalers Advantage agrees).

Terms and conditions are subject to change. Please contact info@wholesalersadvantage.com if
